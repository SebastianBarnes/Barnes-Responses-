		<h1>Clark and Anderson Response</h1>
		<p>The Clark and Anderson reading explains the need for a change in how tools are taught in many of today’s technical communication programs. They explain that an issue many run into in the field is that technical communicators are thought of as tool masters. While there is a recognition that technical communicators do more than make manuals there is still an issue of explain how practitioners add value to the company. </p>
		<p>Clark and Anderson explain that part of the problem is the perception that technology is simply a tool and nothing more. They explain that often technology exists before we know all of its uses, and so to limit our think of it to a tool then we couldn’t think of new ways to use technology. Additionally those who create a technology may not have the context to determine how it would be best used. Clark and Anderson give the example of the early developers of web filters. The developers were contracted to create the technology but when it came to deciding what should be filtered they were unqualified. Ultimately, the technical communicators need to assert themselves as part of the entire process of development if they intend to be valued.</p>
		<p>XML is a great example of how a technology can transcend simply being a tool. While it is essentially a system of labels, it forces you to develop organizational structures that inform the way you structure ideas outside of it. XML is a great tool but the logic structuring that it teaches you is useful at all levels of business.</p>
		<p>In moving forward learning tool I’m going to make an effort to consider not only the value of tool, but also how I can apply its structure elsewhere and how I can change how the tool is used with my other skills</p>
